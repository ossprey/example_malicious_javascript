# GitHub Copilot Best Practices

## Getting Started
- Enable Copilot and Copilot Chat extensions in VS Code.
- Use natural language prompts for code generation, refactoring, and documentation.

## Prompt Engineering
- Be specific with your requests (e.g., "Create a REST API endpoint for user login").
- Use comments to guide Copilot in generating code blocks.
- Ask Copilot Chat for explanations, code reviews, and test generation.

## Code Review
- Use Copilot Chat to review pull requests and suggest improvements.
- Request documentation and inline comments for complex code.

## Troubleshooting
- If Copilot suggestions are off-topic, rephrase your prompt or add more context.

## Shortcuts
- `Alt+Enter` to trigger Copilot suggestions.
- `Ctrl+Enter` to open Copilot Chat.
